# Option #1: Implementing Facial Recognition
For this Portfolio Project Milestone, you will build on the programming requirements presented in Critical Thinking Assignment, Module 1, Option 1. In this Milestone, you will implement a Python program that uses facial recognition to determine if an individual face is present in a group of faces. For example, your program will use facial recognition to determine that the following individual:

Man using a tablet.

is not in the group of people shown here:

Group of people standing in line.

Hints for implementing such a program are found in the following video:

Description: In the video, Deep Learning: Face RecognitionLinks to an external site., you learn that face recognition is used for everything from automatically tagging pictures to unlocking cell phones. And with recent advancements in deep learning, the accuracy of face recognition has improved. In this course, learn how to develop a face recognition system that can detect faces in images, identify the faces, and even modify faces with "digital makeup" like you've experienced in popular mobile apps. Find out how to set up a development environment. Discover tools you can leverage for face recognition. See how a machine learning model can be trained to analyze images and identify facial landmarks. Learn the steps involved in coding facial feature detection, representing a face as a set of measurements, and encoding faces. Additionally, learn how to repurpose and adjust pre-existing systems.
